# JUUN Virtual Assistant
A project I am working on, a virtual assistant named JUUN who assists me in my everyday tasks when using my computer. Eventually will be designed to function for any user on their computer but for now it is being optimized for myself.

Upon starting the application, click run to start JUUN. 
JUUN can then be activated by saying "hey JUUN" (Pronounced June) followed by whatever the users command is.
If the command doesn't exist, JUUN will reply that she doesnt understand, and the command will be noted down as an idea for future versions/updates.

 What can JUUN do? (Functions will be added here upon creation and successful functionality of command):
 - greet user
 - open a website
 - google queries
 - provide the date
 - provide the time
 - ask for the weather
 - take a screenshot of current display
 - put the computer into sleep mode
 - common knowledge query
 - mathematical query
 - open up emails
 - take a note from the user
